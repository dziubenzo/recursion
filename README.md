# Odin Project - Recursion

## Assignment 1
A Fibonacci sequence generator (iterative and recursive). The recursive one uses a bottom-up approach to reduce the number of recursive calls to n (with n being the number up to which Fibonacci sequences are to be calculated).

## Assignment 2
A merge sort algorithm. Works with duplicate and negative numbers. It is consistent with the CS50x pseudocode (sort left half, sort right half, merge both halves).
